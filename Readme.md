# **Monthly Price Forecasting – End-to-End ML Deployment Project**

## **📢 Introduction**

This repository contains the task for developing an end-to-end solution for predicting monthly prices.
You are required to **fork this repository**, complete all tasks, upload all your files (data cleaning, model, deployment, and UI), and submit an updated README clearly explaining your work.

---
## **Business Context**
This case requires trainees to develop a model to forecast average monthly prices for the next 12 months using the provided dataset. The data is available in CSV format and contains historical monthly prices. Candidates may use any suitable machine learning, deep learning (LSTM), or statistical time series forecasting method, such as ARIMA, SARIMA, Prophet or any other appropriate technique of their choice.

Following standard model development procedures, the model should be trained on historical data and evaluated for predictive performance on future months. It is recommended to dedicate time to both fine-tuning the model and interpreting the results.

## **Data Dictionary & Source Acquisition**
•	Data Dictionary: 
1. date – Represents the timestamp in ISO 8601 extended date format: YYYY-MM-DD.

2. avg_monthly_price – Represents the average monthly price.


•	Data Source: The dataset can be found here

## **Candidate Expectations**
Your task is to execute the process for predicting monthly prices while answering the following questions:
1.	Perform data cleaning, including handling missing values, outliers, and anomalies.
2.	Describe your price prediction model in detail and explain the reasons for selecting this model.
3.	Demonstrate the performance of the model using appropriate evaluation metrics.
4.	Suggest actions a company could take to respond to predicted price changes.
5.	Assuming these actions have been implemented, how would you determine if they are effective?
6.	Deploy your trained model to production using any framework of your choice: Flask, FastAPI, or Django.
7.	Explain how you would monitor the model in production, including tracking performance, handling model drift, and updating the model as needed.

## **Submission Requirements**

To complete this task, fork this repository and upload the following into your fork:

The necessary project files (data cleaning, model building, deployment backend + frontend).

An updated README in your fork clearly explaining:

- What you implemented.

- How each task requirement was addressed.

- etc.
